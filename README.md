Questions

1. **Reverse a Singly Linked List**: Write a function that reverses a singly linked list. The function should take the head of the list as input and return the new head of the reversed list.

2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that does not contain any repeating characters. The function should return an integer representing this length.

3. **Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree**: Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum. A path is any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must include at least one node and does not necessarily pass through the root. The function should return an integer representing the maximum path sum found.

4. **Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree**: Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization converts the tree into a sequence of bits to store it in a file, memory buffer, or transmit it across a network. Implement methods `serialize` and `deserialize` for this purpose.

5. **Rotate Array Right by k Steps**: Write a function to rotate an array to the right by `k` steps. The function should modify the array in place to achieve the rotation.

6. **Factorial of a Number**: Write a function to compute the factorial of a given number. The function should return the factorial value.

7. **Sum of Digits**: Write a function to compute the sum of the digits of a given number. The function should return the sum of the digits.

8. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The function should return the GCD.

9. **Maximum Difference Between Elements in Array**: Write a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in an array. The function should return this maximum difference.

10. **Check Alphabetic Characters**: Write a function to check if a given string contains only alphabetic characters. The function should return `true` if the string consists solely of alphabetic characters, and `false` otherwise.
